          <a href="https://brainbrowser.cbrain.mcgill.ca" target="_blank">BrainBrowser</a> is a real-time 3D neurogical data viewer written using HTML5 and related technologies such as WebGL and web workers. The application was originally written by a former colleague of mine, <a href="http://nickassis.net/" target="_blank">Nicolas Kassis</a>, for Google's now defunct O3D plugin. I took over the project in the last few months, ported the code to three.js, added web workers to parse data files in the background, as well as adding other features.

          <a href="http://cbrain.mcgill.ca" target="_blank">CBRAIN</a> is a distributed compute platform for neuroimaging research. CBRAIN provides researchers with access to high performance computing centers across Canada and globally, storage for their data as well as processing tools with which to analyze it, and a web front end allowing for a more intuitive experience than the comand-line interface these resources generally require. CBRAIN was written in Ruby on Rails with a MySQL database backend. The grid infrasctructure was built using custom wrappers around standard Unix tools such as rsync and ssh.

          <a href="http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/598131" target="_blank">Red Square</a> was a smaller side project and my first foray into game design. I created it during the 2012 Qu√©bec student protests to express the atmosphere of the moment, in particular the feeling of an organized, organic chaos and the power dynamic between protesters and the police. Red Square was created using <a href="http://www.stencyl.com/" target="_blank">Stencyl</a>, <a href="http://www.gimp.org/" target="_blank">GIMP</a>, <a href="http://paintbrush.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">Paintbrush</a> and <a href="http://audacity.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">Audacity</a>.

          I'm currently working in web development at the Montreal Neurological Institute of McGill University as a lead developer on 
          <a href="https://brainbrowser.cbrain.mcgill.ca" target="_blank">BrainBrowser</a> and <a href="http://cbrain.mcgill.ca" target="_blank">CBRAIN</a>. My work tends to focus on the front end, using Ruby on Rails, HTML, JavaScript, CSS and jQuery, with some back end work on a MySQL database. For BrainBrowser, I've begun using <a href="http://threejs.org/" target="_blank">three.js</a> a lot for 3D rendering.
        </p>
        <p>
          My current interests center around web development, 3D graphics and game design, though I'm really just getting started in the latter two. These days, I'm focusing on getting a better understanding of 3D graphics principles, in particular using <a href="http://www.khronos.org/webgl/" target="_blank">WebGL</a>, both through the raw API and through <a href="http://threejs.org/" target="_blank">three.js</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          My postgraduate studies were in Computational Linguistics, with a focus on machine learning algorithms for automated transliteration between Arabic and English.
